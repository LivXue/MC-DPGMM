## Multi-view Clustering With Unknown Cluster Number

This repository contains the author's implementation in PyTorch for the TPAMI submission "Multi-view Clustering With Unknown Cluster Number".

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.9)

- PyTorch (>=1.12.1)

## Datasets
You can download the features of the datasets from:
 - Caltech, 
 - MNIST-USPS, 
 - BDGP,

 ## Implementation

Here we provide the implementation of our proposed model, along with datasets. The repository is organised as follows:

 - `data/` contains the necessary dataset files;
 - `nework.py` contains the implementation of our odel;
 
 Finally, `train.py` puts all of the above together and can be used to execute a full training.
